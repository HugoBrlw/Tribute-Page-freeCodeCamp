        <h3 id="headline">Here's one of Wigglesworth's teachings: Healing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Wigglesworth believed that healing came through faith, and he was flexible in his approach.</li>
          <li>
            When he was forbidden to lay hands on audience members by the authorities in Sweden, he preached for a “corporate healing”, by which people laid hands on themselves.
          </li>
          <li>
            He also practiced anointing with oil, and the distribution of “prayer handkerchiefs” (one of which was sent to King George V).
          </li>
          <li>
            Wigglesworth sometimes attributed ill-health to demons.
          </li>
          <li>
            There were numerous claims of divine healing during Wigglesworth’s ministry. These include a woman healed of a tumor, a woman healed of tuberculosis, a wheelchair-confined woman walking, and many more.. There were reports that people were raised from the dead, including his wife Polly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many people said they were cured of cancer by Jesus Christ through him. Wigglesworth, whose only training was as a plumber, described cancer as “a living evil spirit”, and insisted that many diseases were “satanic in origin”.
          </li>
          <li>
            His methods often involved hitting, slapping or punching the afflicted part of the body. On a number of occasions his approach to persons suffering from stomach complaints was to punch them in the stomach, sometimes with such force that it propelled them across the room. When challenged on this, his response was “I don’t hit them, I hit the devil”. Responding to criticism over his method of praying for the sick, Wigglesworth stated: “You might think by the way I went about praying for the sick that I was sometimes unloving and rough, but oh, friends, you have no idea what I see behind the sickness and the one who is afflicted. I am not dealing with the person; I am dealing with the satanic forces that are binding the afflicted”.
          </li>
          <li>
            On one occasion Wigglesworth declared to the sick “I’ll only pray for you once, to pray twice is unbelief”. The second night, a man approached the altar to receive prayer again and Wigglesworth, recognizing him, said “Didn’t I pray for you last night? You are full of unbelief, get off this platform!”
          </li>
          <li>
            Smith would pray and the blind would see, and the deaf were healed, people came out of wheelchairs, and cancers were destroyed. One remarkable story is when He prayed for a woman in a hospital. While he and a friend were praying she died. He took her out of the bed stood her against the wall and said “in the name of Jesus I rebuke this death”. Her whole body began to tremble. The he said “in the name of Jesus walk”, and she walked.
          </li>
          <li>
            Everywhere he would go he would teach and then show the power of God. He began to receive requests from all over the world. He taught in Europe, Asia, New Zealand and many other areas. When the crowds became very large he began a “wholesale healing”. He would have everyone who needed healing lay hands on themselves and then he would pray. Hundreds would be healed at one time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Over Smith’s ministry it was confirmed that 14 people were raised from the dead. Thousands were saved and healed and he impacted whole continents for Christ.
          </li>
          <li>Smith largely believed his ministerial success was due to his speaking in tongues. He said:

“I want you to see that he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself or builds himself up. We must be edified before we can edify the church. I cannot estimate what I, personally, owe to the Holy Ghost method of spiritual edification. I am here before you as one of the biggest conundrums in the world. There never was a weaker man on the platform. Language? None. Inability–full of it. All natural things in my life point exactly opposite to my being able to stand on the platform and preach the gospel. The secret is that the Holy Ghost came and brought this wonderful edification of the Spirit. I had been reading this Word continually as well as I could, but the Holy Ghost came and took hold of it, for the Holy Ghost is the breath of it, and He illuminated it to me.”</li>
          <li>
            He continued to minister until the time of his death on 12 March 1947.

            His ministry was based on four principles ” First, read the Word of God. Second, consume the Word of God until it consumes you. Third believe the Word of God. Fourth, act on the Word.”
